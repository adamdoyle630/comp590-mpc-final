A brief description of the project.

\end{abstract}


\section{Introduction}

This document provides a template for the project update. The introduction should motivate and explain your project goals. The introduction should make clear to someone who reads the paper why this is a worthwhile project to work on and explain the real-world problems that the project will solve.

It may be helpful to cite various sources throughout the project update and final paper. You can cite papers like this~\cite{item1}.

\section{Solution Overview}

This brief overview of your solution should give enough detail to convince the reader that you know exactly how you're going to solve the technical problems involved in your proposed project.

\section{Progress Update}

Be sure to include the following in your update:
\begin{itemize}
\item What has been accomplished so far.

\item What each team member has done.

\item A GitHub (or other source code repository) link to your project code.
\end{itemize}

Remember that your project update should be 2-3 pages long, excluding references and appendices.

You can also use this template for your final report, but remember that there will be additional sections that you need to add for that part.
