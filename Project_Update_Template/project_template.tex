\section{Introduction}

% This document provides a template for the project update. The introduction should motivate and explain your project goals. The introduction should make clear to someone who reads the paper why this is a worthwhile project to work on and explain the real-world problems that the project will solve.

% It may be helpful to cite various sources throughout the project update and final paper. You can cite papers like this~\cite{item1}.

\section{Solution Overview}

This brief overview of your solution should give enough detail to convince the reader that you know exactly how you're going to solve the technical problems involved in your proposed project.

\section{Progress Update}

\subsection*{Accomplishments}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend Setup:} We have successfully set up a working frontend for our project.
    
    \item \textbf{Cloud Function Development:} We have developed a functional cloud function to handle data input and perform linear regression analysis. While this function is not finalized, it currently computes the slope and intercept of a linear regression model based on the provided data. 
    
    \item \textbf{Algorithm Development:} We have developed algorithms to compute essential statistical metrics including standard deviation, correlation, and linear regression for our model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Contributions of Team Members}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Swagat:} Swagat has primarily worked on drafting the cloud function responsible for inputting data and outputting the slope and intercept of the linear regression model.
    
    \item \textbf{Praj:} Praj has focused on developing algorithms to calculate standard deviation, correlation, and linear regression for our model.
\end{itemize}
