\begin{abstract}

This project seeks to implement Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques to securely gather and analyze sensitive data about the student body at the University of North Carolina without compromising individual privacy.
Using a combination of frontend and backend technologies, the project will collect data on various metrics such as average academic tenure, financial aid received, family income levels, and GPA, among others. 
The goal is to calculate not only averages but also medians, standard deviations, and to perform linear regression analyses between selected variables. 
By splitting data into encrypted shares that are stored across multiple databases, the system ensures that no single party can access comprehensive personal data, thereby maintaining privacy and security. 
Preliminary works have included the development of a responsive frontend user interface and the backend setup for data encryption and distribution. 
This allows for a deep, analytical, yet secure insight into demographic patterns, academic performance, and other crucial metrics, allowing for crucial insights for the university in allocating resources in addressing need areas.

In an era where data privacy has become crucial to maintaining anonymity, educational institutions face significant challenges in collecting and analyzing student data without violating privacy norms and regulations. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) offers a solution to this dilemma by allowing multiple parties to compute functions over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. The relevance of MPC in secure data analysis has been extensively documented, with successful applications ranging from secure auctions to privacy-preserving data mining~\cite{MPC1}.

At the University of North Carolina, there is a substantial need to understand the student body's demographics, academic performance, financial needs, and overall well-being without exposing individual data. This project aims to implement an MPC framework to gather and analyze such data securely. Specifically, the framework will handle sensitive information such as GPA, financial aid details, and family income, enabling the university to derive insightful analytics like average study durations, aid distributions, and academic performance indicators across various demographics without revealing or compromising sensitive personal data.

By leveraging front-end and back-end technologies to encrypt and split data into shares distributed among multiple databases, this project ensures that no single entity can reconstruct or access the entirety of the sensitive data, thus adhering to privacy standards. Such methodologies are aligned with current trends in secure computations and the increasing demand for privacy-preserving analytical techniques in higher education.

The implementation of this project aims to enhance the strategic planning and resource allocation at the university but also serves as a model for other institutions grappling with similar issues. This update offers a detailed discussion on the project's objectives, the technology stack involved, and the preliminary results obtained from the initial implementation stages.

\section{Solution Overview}

In the development of a secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) library, we focused on creating functionalities crucial for collaborative data processing without compromising individual privacy. The library includes methods for generating and managing shares across distinct servers, ensuring data security by keeping individual inputs encrypted and only making aggregated data public. We utilized Beaver triples and masks for secure operations such as multiplications, essential in MPC protocols. The prime modulus \( P \) set to \( 2^{32} - 1 \) provides a robust framework for operations by maintaining calculations within a finite field. The library supports computations of statistical measures like mean and standard deviation securely, with plans to extend this to calculating correlation coefficients. This approach maintains the confidentiality of individual data while enabling the extraction of valuable statistical information from aggregated server data.
