A brief description of the project.

This project seeks to implement Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques to securely gather and analyze sensitive data about the student body at the University of North Carolina without compromising individual privacy.
Using a combination of frontend and backend technologies, the project will collect data on various metrics such as average academic tenure, financial aid received, family income levels, and GPA, among others. 
The goal is to calculate not only averages but also medians, standard deviations, and to perform linear regression analyses between selected variables. 
By splitting data into encrypted shares that are stored across multiple databases, the system ensures that no single party can access comprehensive personal data, thereby maintaining privacy and security. 
Initial phases have included the development of a responsive frontend user interface and the backend setup for data encryption and distribution. 
This allows for a deep, analytical, yet secure insight into demographic patterns, academic performance, and other crucial metrics, allowing for crucial insights for the university in allocating resources in addressing need areas.

\section{Introduction}

% This document provides a template for the project update. The introduction should motivate and explain your project goals. The introduction should make clear to someone who reads the paper why this is a worthwhile project to work on and explain the real-world problems that the project will solve.

In an era where data privacy has become paramount, educational institutions face significant challenges in collecting and analyzing student data without violating privacy norms and regulations. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) offers a promising solution to this dilemma by allowing multiple parties to compute functions over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. The relevance of MPC in secure data analysis has been extensively documented, with successful applications ranging from secure auctions to privacy-preserving data mining~\cite{MPC1}.

At the University of North Carolina, there is a substantial need to understand the student body's demographics, academic performance, financial needs, and overall well-being without exposing individual data. This project aims to implement an MPC framework to gather and analyze such data securely. Specifically, the framework will handle sensitive information such as GPA, financial aid details, and family income, enabling the university to derive insightful analytics like average study durations, aid distributions, and academic performance indicators across various demographics without revealing or compromising sensitive personal data.

By leveraging front-end and back-end technologies to encrypt and split data into shares distributed among multiple databases, this project ensures that no single entity can reconstruct or access the entirety of the sensitive data, thus adhering to privacy standards. Such methodologies are aligned with current trends in secure computations and the increasing demand for privacy-preserving analytical techniques in higher education.

The implementation of this project not only aims to enhance the strategic planning and resource allocation at the university but also serves as a model for other institutions grappling with similar issues. This introduction sets the stage for a detailed discussion on the project's objectives, the technology stack involved, and the preliminary results obtained from the initial implementation stages.

This brief overview of your solution should give enough detail to convince the reader that you know exactly how you're going to solve the technical problems involved in your proposed project.

\section{Progress Update}

\subsection*{Accomplishments}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend Setup:} We have successfully set up a working frontend for our project, which currently consists of a basic HTML form for user input that will eventually be parsed and sent to our backend server. 
    
    \item \textbf{Cloud Function Development:} We have developed a cloud function to handle data input and perform linear regression analysis. While this function is not finalized, it currently computes the slope and intercept of a linear regression model based on the provided data. 
    
    \item \textbf{Algorithm Development:} We have developed algorithms to compute essential statistical metrics including standard deviation, correlation, and linear regression for our model.~\cite{MPC1}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Contributions of Team Members}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Swagat:} Swagat has primarily worked on drafting the cloud function responsible for inputting data and outputting the slope and intercept of the linear regression model.
    
    \item \textbf{Praj:} Praj has focused on developing algorithms to calculate standard deviation, correlation, and linear regression for our model.

    \item \textbf{Adam:} Adam has primarily responsible for creating and configuring the GitHub repository for this project and is currently drafting ideas for the server configurations needed to simulate MPC, with the main challenge being creating multiple servers that are independent and secure from each other. 
    
    \item \textbf{Kevin:} Kevin has been focused on developing the front end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Currently working on connecting it with the backend. 
\end{itemize}
